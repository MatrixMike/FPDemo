add .gitignore
find out why :
errors noted are caused- 
how to have TEXT all characters available

why does third append for lcs cause failure
does java.util.Date have bad effect - 
are we stretching a bit to use Java 1.8 even though -source 1.3 used on invocation line

some errors seem wierd - are they to do with the CLDC version? somewhere I recall seeing that between CLDC 1.0 and 1.1 some sensitivity to strings and integers was created -

add an icon 

add documentation such that javadocs will read and generate usable info

separate the lcs class into another file

investigate the package stmt

add some tests - junit? - a side idea was to work with pythagorean triplets

sign the MIDlet - needs some understanding of security

looks like I have separated the lcs class into another file: stackoverflow used but the answer was not 100%; the class to be separated needs to have the phrase package <>; and it seems the compiler will pick it up {must scan many .java files for this?!}

added pythagorean triplet with help from geany : add package <> ; to file and use partial typing of class and auto complete - 
 - which completes the class name and displays the available methods

after recent re-discovery of how to push local repo to github, checking local source
